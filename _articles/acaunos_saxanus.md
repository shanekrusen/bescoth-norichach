**Etymology:**

It is almost without question that *Saxanus*, the name under which this deity appears in Noricum, is of Latin origin ("of the stones") and that His cult originated in Central Italy.\[1] However, His relation to other deities with semantically similar names is still up in the air. De Bernardo Stempel essentially describes *"Saxanus"* as a Latin parallel of an indigenous Celtic theonym from Pannonia Superior: *Agaunus/Agannus* (from *Acaunos* = "of the stones").\[2] This connection, however, is only valid semantically. Upon realizing that de Bernardo Stempel is referrencing the Vindobona altar\[3] in this line, it becomes  obvious that the deities are unrelated. The altar itself is erected at the confluence of the Danube and the Wien river, which was once called the *Acaunus* river. This, along with a newer reading of the theonym in the altar as *Acaunus*, makes it clear that the deity in question is the patron god of the "stony river"\[4], not a parallel with Saxanus. In another piece, de Bernardo Stempel relates *Saxanus* to another Celtic theonym, *Carnios*.\[5] This is, as far as can be understood without an inline citation, a referrence to the theonym *Carneus Calantice(n)sis* from Lusitania. This is a particularly difficult position to reconcile, since in 2013 de Bernardo Stempel seems to accept Prosper's identification of *Carneus* as the Celtic theonym *Karnios* ("of the cairns")\[6], but yet in 2014 seems to reject it.\[7] Regardless, semantically, both *Acaunos* and *Carnios* are acceptable Celtic epithets for the deity called *Saxanus* in Noricum. 

**Function:**

The connection of the epithet *Saxanus* with *Hercules* is best explored through His connection with Roman military units serving in quarries and mines. This connection was identified fairly early on, at least when *Saxanus* was still considered of either Germanic or Celtic origin\[8] and not, as He is now understood, certianly Roman.\[9]\[10] There are a few inferences to draw from the etymology of His name, and the nature of His cult practice. The first, obviously, is that of a patron of quarrymen, miners, and masonry.\[11] The second, as Derks describes is related to the quality of *Hercules* as "conqueror of mountains."\[12] The final, and possibly most appealing, is related to *Hercules'* role as a patron of career (or general fortune-bringer), and given an appropriate epithet by worker-legionaries in the Roman military.\[13]

**In Practice:**

Within *Bessus Noricon*, this deity shall be referred to as *Acaunos*. The Celtic word \**acaunon* is attested in toponyms (and a hydronym, as previously explored) in the general region of Noricum\[14], and is an appropriate Celtic alternative to a Latin epithet. He is a patron of quarrymen and miners, a patron of laborers and labor itself, as well as a patron of career and bringer of fortune.

**Interpretatio:**

Hercules

**Iconography:**

Apart from the typical tools of a quarryman/miner (such as the pickaxe), it is not unreasonable to assume He also would be associated with the typical trappings of a *Hercules* figure (such as the club).
