Very often, part of a complete religious tradition is the idea of the mortal interacting with the supernatural in a more or less direct way. This is reflected *thoroughly* in the antique Roman world in the form of *tabella defixiones*, or curse tablets. 

This is no less true for the lands of the Norici. The most prominent *defixio* from the region is a lead curse tablet from what is now Sisak, Croatia.
