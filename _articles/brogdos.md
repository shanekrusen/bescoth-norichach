**Etymology:**

*Brogdos* has the esteemed honor of being the only Celtic deity attested in an actual Celtic inscription within Noricum, from a funerary vase inscribed with "ARTEBUDZ BROGDUI". His name is interpreted as coming from celtic \**-brog(i)*\[1], meaning 'territory, region, frontier, border'.\[2]

**Function:**

*Brogdos'* role has been interpreted, first and foremost, as that of a liminal deity and a psychopomp. Based on His invocation on a funerary vase, He is closely associated with borders, guarding the boundary between the mortal world and the underworld, and the protection of property when entering the next life.\[3]\[4]

**In Practice:**

On-top of his psychopomp nature, it is possible to see a more nuanced role for *Brogdos* by comparing Him with other psychopomp-liminal deities. By taking into account the importance of trade/travel within *Noricum*\[5], it is likely that *Brogdos* also served as the protector of trade, travel, merchants, as well as the crossing of borders, despite their nature. 

**Interpretatio:**

Mercury/Hermes

**Iconography:**

Finding iconography for *Brogdos* will be more of a guessing-game than anything, as He is attested in a single inscription without image. The best that can be done, in this case, is to find symbolism related to other liminal-psychopomp deities, like Mercury or Hermes. These include: the Caduceus (or simply dual snakes), the winged helmet, the tortoise, and the rooster.\[6]\[7]
