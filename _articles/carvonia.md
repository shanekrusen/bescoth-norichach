**Etymology:**

De Bernardo Stempel, along with Scherrer, argues that Carvonia is an attributive form on \**-yā* from an earlier \**Karvona* ('deer Goddess') from IE \**k̂ṛwo-* ('cervus') affixed with the female theonymic suffix *-onā*.\[1]\[2]

**Function:**

According to Šašel Kos, *Carvonia* is "a deity of nature, forests, and hunting."\[3] She also elaborates that this resemblance to Artemis/Diana is important, as worship of Artemis is attested among the Southeastern Alpine celts by Greco-Roman sources, who detail the Celtic practice of sacrificing annually to Artemis.\[4] This may be reinforced by a possible Norican myth attested in the *Suda Encyclopedia* and its similarity to the myth of the *Calydonian Boar*.\[5]\[6] 

**In Practice:**

In Bessus Noricon, *Carvonia* is a goddess of nature, the forest, and the hunt, likely also with connotations of fertility and abundance. 

**Interpretatio:**

Although unattested epigraphically, *Carvonia* would likely be interpreted as Artemis or Diana.

**Iconography:**

According to Her name, as well as her connection to the Cult Cart of Strettweg\[7], she is strongly asociated with deer.
