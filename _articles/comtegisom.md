Just as the similarities between the Athenian and Norican cultures have been explored in this series before\[1], so too will this association be used to further flesh out Norican culture, by using certain Athenian festivals as the basis for Norican innovated ones. To begin, Athens and the Norici are similar also in their apparent hegemonic dominance of other nearby peoples. It is therefore posited here that *Bessus Noricon* will have a festival honoring the political unity of the Norican tribes, taking after the Athenian *Synoikia*.

Essential to the Athenian *Synoikia* is the hero-cult of the mythical Athenian king, Theseus. Theseus was regarded as the founder of the Athenian state in antiquity, and eventually became the subject of a widespread hero cult, intimately connected with Athenian nationalism\[2]. In this regard, there is no such known foundation myth among the Norici. There are, however, historical accounts of what are very likely the first king of Noricum: Cincibilus.\[3] It is therefore also posited here that Cincibilus will be the subject of a Norican hero-cult as the unifier of the Norican kingdom. This association of *Cincinilus* with Theseus is even more interesting when one considers the motifs of "bull-slaying" prominent in the cult of Theseus.\[4] This becomes especially relevant when considering that *Cincibilus'* rise to power likely would have necessitated a subjugation war against the *Taurisci*, an ethnonym which De Bernardo Stempel interprets as "Tribe of the Bull".\[5] It therefore follows also to posit the worship of *Cincibilus* as *Cincibilus Taurouanos*. 

In terms of an actual festival itself, elements, what few there are known, can be assimilated directly from the *Synoikia*. For one, it is important to understand the festival as a commemorative event.\[6] It is further worth noting that the festival was also inextricably tied to Athena.\[7] From this, it can be postulated that the Norican *Īuos Comtegisom* would be a festival for both *Cincibilus Taurouanos* and *Noreia*.\[8] Unfortunately, no ritual activity besides simply sacrifice is attested. There is, however, attestations of a bloodless sacrifice being offered to the Greek *Eirene* on the same day as the *Synoikia* was traditionally held.\[9] It is therefore posited here that the main sacrifice (along with normal dedications of libations, etc. to *Noreia* and *Cincibilus*) for *Īuos Comtegisom* will be that of service. As a festival with connotations of transition from chaos to peace\[10], it is suggested here that community service of some kind should be a regular part of *Īuos Comtegisom* in the modern-day. In this way, a practitioner may actively partake in helping the world transition a little further from chaos into peace. (It may also be mentioned here that, as a festival marking a time of transition, *Īuos Comtegisom* may also be associated with Cernunnos.\[11] If inclined, He may be added to the list of *Dewoi* that receive special attention on *Īuos Comtegisom*.)

Finally, a date must be selected for *Īuos Comtegisom*. Traditionally, the *Synoikia* is held on the 16th day of the Athenian month of Hekatombaion, which aligns with July/August.\[12] This Athenian month would, then, coincide with the Gaulish month of Riuros. The 16th day of Riuros is part of a large *Īuos* run associated with the festival of *Lugus*, so this time of the year would already be considered a particularly sacred time, and perfect for the purpose of this festival. It is also particulary of use to note that the 16th day of the Gaulish month, marks the beginning of the second half of the month (another time of transition), which the Gauls clearly saw as separate, as is shown by the Coligny Calendar.\[13] It is therefore posited here that *Īuos Comtegisom* be celebrated on the 16th day of Riuros.
