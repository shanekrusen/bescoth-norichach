**Etymology:**

Before diving into the etymology of *Eracura*'s name, it must be clarified that the theonym appears in countless different variations, and although it may not be the "true" form, *"Eracura"* will be used here because it is the form in which the theonym is found within Noricum. With that clarification, the discussion of the etymology of *Eracura*'s name is no less complicated. Many theories have been floating around academia for years, and new ones seem to be developing in real-time. Some are more believablem than others. For example, Polomé's suggestion that the name can be broken down as \**(p)eri-* and \**k̑er-* (to the effect of 'aggressive/intense growth') and that *Eracura* is a vegetation goddess\[1] is now widely discredited.\[2] Green's attempt to connect the name to that of *Hecate* is also not widely believed.\[3] Delamarre gives an interpretation of \**ēri-cūrā*, which he defines as "Vent-d'Ouest",\[4] although this is criticized for both semantic and phonological reasons.\[6] From Olmsted, we get a rare balanced summary of the theories that were available to him at the time of his writing. Among these, he echoes the vegetation-goddess theory, as well as proposes another possible meaning of "Before the Bread". Apart from the less useful ideas, Olmsted also imparts a very useful piece of information: the first element in the theonym might, in fact, be derived from the intensive prefix \**(p)eri-*. Although Olmsted's thoughts on the second element are not entirely well-supported, at least one (the IE stem \**kū-ro‑* "strong", i.e. "the Very Strong")\[7] is entertained as plausible by Falileyev. Falileyev, however, seems to place the most weight behind the idea that the name *may* not be a compound, and he implies that it may be an aggentive form of the intensive prefix itself (i.e. "The Intense/Plentiful")\[8]. The idea that the name is not a compound may actually be the most credible theory. However, the most credible of its variants appears to come from de Bernardo Stempel, despite Falileyev's criticism.\[9] De Bernardo Stempel suggests that *Eracura*'s name may be derived from an original association with trees, and the variants are, ultimately, from a form \**Hercurā*. In her own words, de Bernardo Stempel believes that *Eracura* is "derived from the IE name of the oak (\**perk<sup>w</sup>u-*)<sup>82</sup> – with the delabialization of the labiovelar before the labial vowel -u- found in the pre-Gaulish period – \[and] more likely alluded to the deity of the life-tree. In fact, (1) the \**pérk<sup>(w)</sup>ura* to which we can trace it back seems to be related to the Baltic god PERKÚNAS of IE heritage."\[10]

**Function:**

Many aspects of *Eracura*'s cult are actually pretty well-known. Green, in this regard, gives a perfectly adequate summary. Green explains that *Eracura* fills a role similar to *Hecate*, and that she embodies aspects of fertility, prosperity, and (due to her frequent portrayal as a divine couple with Dis Pater) protecting the dead.\[11] To add to this, She may also have been related to *Brixtā* (magic), since she is often found in defixiones. Particularly relevant to this practice, She is also invoked in a Norican love spell.\[12]

**In Practice:**

Within *Bessus Noricon*, *Eracura* is a goddess of fertility, prosperity, wealth, the cthonic, and the dead. She is a goddess of *Brixtā* in general (an association which makes sense given her possible connection to the world-tree), and of cthonic magic in particular. 

**Interpretatio:**

Variously: Terra Mater, Proserpina, Cybele, or Juno.

**Iconography:**

She is often associated with a mix of typical fertility/mother goddess and cthonic imagery. She is often portrayed seated with a basket of fruit.\[13]\[14] If de Bernardo Stempel is correct in her association of *Eracura* with the world-tree, she may also embody aspects of triplism, an aspect mirrored in Hecate.
