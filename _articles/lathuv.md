**Etymology:**

The most recent satisfactory etymology of *Latobius* comes from Wolfgang Meid, and his interpretation faces next to no criticism. Meid interprets the divine name in full as "He who strikes with fury", from Celtic \**lāto-biyos* with a literal meaning closer to "in fighting fury".\[1]\[2] This interpretation is supported by de Bernardo Stempel in 2003\[3], and again in 2005.\[4]

**Function:**

It is possible that *Latobius* is the titular tribal god of the Latobici.\[5] This, however, does not alter interpretation of His function much; it simply may help to frame it. De Bernardo Stempel calls Him a war god, specifically.\[6] Šašel Kos assumes that his function was primarily related to welfare-bringing and to healing.\[6] She also makes note that His sanctuaries were called *navale* in inscriptions. She elaborates that this may have meant a.) a kind of sun-boat, portraying *Latobius* as a solar-deity; b.) to stress the importance of water in the cult of *Latobius*; c.) that *Latobius* is related to ferrying the dead; or d.) that the word *navale* simply implied a "specially constructed (sacral) building".\[7] If one of these interpretations can be believed, then they all certainly can if one factors in the interpretation of Jack Lindsay, which places all of these functions firmly in the purview of Celtic tribal deities.\[8]

**In Practice:**

In Bescoth Norichach, *Latobius* (GhA: *Lâthuv*) will be a god similar to *Belinos*, of particualr interest to the Latobici. He will oversee elements of healing, the solar cult, the water cult, of a *psychopomp*, and of combat. In this interpretation, he will be of particular interest for *Bes'nerth Nhorichach* or Norican athletic cult. 

**_Interpretatio:_**

*Latobius* is almost universally equated with Mars.

**Iconography:**

In a reconstructed marble statue from the sanctuary at Sankt Margarethen, He is portrayed with a crested helmet, a spear, and a shield.\[9]
