**Preface:**

The deeper one digs for information on the pre-Roman religion and cult practices of the Eastern Alpine regions, the more it becomes painfully clear that scholarly published works on _this_ aspect of Norican culture (work on Norican material culture happens to be flourishing) are somewhat lacking, at least in the English language. That isn't to say that there is absolutely **_no_** mainstream material on the topic, as evidenced by widespread and, occasionally, sensationalized information on Norican deities like Belenos (although an argument can be made that he is more popular from his presence elsewhere) and particularly Noreia, who perhaps has more recently been understood as no goddess of the Noricans at all and must, then, necissarilly be debunked in a discussion of Celtic religion in Noricum. To this end and partially due to a lack of specific academic attention to the subject, the works of Šašel Kos and de Bernardo Stempel are an irreplacable resource. 

**Etymology:**

Although the question of Her name's etymology is, as of yet, not decisively settled, it can be roughly determined to be one of two possibilities: that of a Celtic origin or that of a pre-Celtic origin. Although Šašel Kos, citing Hedwig Kenner, attributes the name as 'most likely pre-Celtic'\[1\], the more recent proposition of de Bernardo Stempel seems better founded, especially in light of new research and the collaborative efforts of F.E.R.C.AN. De Bernardo Sempel suggests Noreia as a detoponym, i.e. a theonym from a toponym. He suggests the toponym being itself derived from the ethnonym 'Norici', by means of suffix replacement (-eia for -ici), with 'Norici' breaking down as the plural of the Celtic \**nor-iko-s* ('the manly'), with \**nor-* deriving from IE 'manly, strong'\[2\]. In short, it is more recently being suggested that Noreia's name is derived from the name of the town (the capital) of the people whose name the town bears.

It is worth mentioning that She appears in one dedication as Veica Noriceia (which is notably older than certain other popular dedications to Noreia-Isis), with the Celtic origin of "Veica" being a certainty, and de Bernardo Stempel breaking it down as  \**weik-ā*, i.e. "the one of the battle"\[3\]. Šašel Kos likely incorrectly refutes this interpretation, citing Holder's assertion of Veica as Celtic, while discussing similarities of "Veica" to personal and place names from nearby non-Celtic areas, and providing in its place an only tentative possible connection to the Histrian theonym "Ica".\[4\] 

**Function:** 

It has been proposed (mainly, according to Šašel Kos, by Kenner and Takács) that She is a polyvalent mother-goddess, with aspects of a protectress, fertility, nature, welfare, healing, and the chthonic.\[5\] This interpretation, however, is contradicted by the epigraphic evidence, and therein lies the problematic nature of the goddess most often associated with Noricum. All of the dedications to Her are a) in Latin and b) known to have been made by wealthy Romans, serving either in administration or in the military. Although Latin dedications to known Celtic gods are not uncommon, it is this fact combined with the identity of Her dedicators that must lead one to believe that Noreia is more likely a Roman invention than an indigenous Norican mother goddess,\[6\] serving as the personification of the province of Noricum itself. 

**In Practice:**

Although Noreia, as she existed in history, was likely more important to Roman administrators in Noricum than to the indigenous Celts, it has been proposed\[7\], and  is probably very likely, that some form of epichoric mother-goddess or female patron goddess was worshipped by the indigenous Noricans before their incorporation into the Roman state (although Zajaç provides no alternatives to Noreia). With this in mind, it is here proposed that Noreia be taken up as an epithet for this as of yet unknown patroness for the practices of Bescoth Norichach, as a possibly misused name for Her is better than no name at all.
