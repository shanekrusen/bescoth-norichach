Long before the *Regnum Noricum* entered the historical record, the *Norici* were ruled by a king called Uinatos. One year, during the annual offering to the gods at the Sanctuary on the *Magdalensberg*, he forgot to make his offering to *Caruonia*. Enraged, She released upon the Norici the most horrid and ferocious boar known to the world. Upon realizing his mistake, Uinatos arranged immediately for a hunting party to slay the beast. For many days, the party hunted and attacked the beast and for many days the beast repelled them, the party becoming smaller with each encounter. This continued until the beast came upon the walls of the city on the *Magdalensberg*, where many of the Norici were in hiding. Upon seeing the beast before the city, a local Norican named *Nertacus* strode alone out from the safety of the city walls. He alone wrestled the beast and, finally, having conquered it, forced the beast onto its back and hoisted it upon his own shoulders. *Nertacus'* act of lone bravery and valour was met with cheers from his countrymen. "Oinouiros! Oinouiros!" ("One man! One man!") This chant would go on to become the name of the city at the *Magdalensberg*, even unto the Latin tongue, as Virunum.

The inspiration for this myth comes from a story attested in the *Suda Encyclopedia*, beta.265:

> *For the Noricians are a people, where a divinely-sent monster of a boar was ravaging the land, and everyone who tried to attack it achieved nothing, until a certain man, turning the pig over, put it up on his shoulders, somewhat as the story is also related about Calydon. And the Noricians shouted out 'One man!' in their own language â€” that is, berounous. From this the city was called Berounion.*
