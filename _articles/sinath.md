**Etymology:**

On the origin of the divine name *Sinatis*, most scholarship is actually agreed. De Bernardo Stempel and Delamarre give a Celtic root \**sino-*, meaning 'collar' or 'chain', with the aggentive i-stem suffix \**-ātis*. This is reinforced by a parallel with Irish mythology in the form of *sín*, a kind of collar which, when placed around the neck of an accused, would strangle the guilty and release the innocent.\[1]

**Function:**

It should come as no surprise, given the Etymology of His name and its relation to its cognate in Irish mythology, that *Sinatis* is interpreted as a god of Justice in Noricum.\[2] This is by no means a stretch, as the concept of law and justice is well attested among the Continental Celts\[3] (even appearing in Greco-Roman literary sources, albeit as a trope\[4]), and has recently been the topic of thorough study.\[5]

**In Practice:**

In Bescoth Norichach, *Sinatis* (or *Sinath*) will be a god of justice and right, a virtue commonly associated with the Gaulish idea of "honor".\[6]

**_Interpretatio:_**

It is hard to definitively ascribe *Sinatis* a Roman counterpart, although He is attested in an inscription with several other theonyms: MARTI LATOBIO MARMOGIO SINATI TOUTATI Mog\[ET]IO. This could be a dedication two one deity, two, or even six.\[7]\[8]\[9] Given this inscription, it is possible He was associated with Mars.

**Iconography:**

According to his name\[10], either chains/shackles or a collar. It is also possible that by comparison with similar deities on the Continent, the Torque would have been part of His iconography.\[11]
