**Etymology:**

De Bernardo Stempel puts forth the origin of *Veica*'s name as \**weik-ā*, which she explains as "the fighting One", from the root \**weik-*.\[1] York explains this word as "a root-notion \[in which] the ideas of both battle and wonder-working \[are combined]."\[2]

**Function:**

De Bernardo Stempel calls Her a "battle goddess."\[3] In light of the etymology of Her name, this seems more than appropriate. 

**In Practice:**

It is clear through etymological analysis and comparison with similar goddesses\[4] the role that *Veica* serves within *Bessus Noricon*. She is a protectress and a worker of miracles in battle. From Her comes the strength for tremendous feats of combat or athleticism!

**Interpretatio:**

Although unattested in antiquity, likely Victory or Bellona.

**Iconography:**

None attested, although any typical symbology of war deities can be imagined.
