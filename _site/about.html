            <h2>Am Dengu, Swêas, ach Râiâdhan // On Language, Identity, and Purpose</h2>
            <p>Swâel! (Welcome!) Welcome to Bescoth Norichach, a modern attempt to chronicle and explore the old Celtic relgious practices of the Eastern Alpine Celts, especially those of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Carni</li>
  <li>and the Taurisci Federation:
    <ul>
      <li>the Alauni</li>
      <li>the Ambidravi/Ambidrani</li>
      <li>the Ambilici</li>
      <li>the Ambisontes/Ambisontii</li>
      <li>the Norici</li>
      <li>the Sevaces</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For the purpose of clarity in the rest of this project, I will likely refer to this tradition as “Norican” or “Norichach”, after the Kingdom of Noricum, although the Norici were likely just a part of the larger Taurisci federation.</p>

<p>Before I continue, I would like to thank Selgowiros Caranticnos of Senobessus Bolgon (which you may find <a href="https://senobessusbolgon.wordpress.com/">here</a>) for the incredible work he has done in bringing to life the old customs of the Belgae, and for the encouragement and inspiration he has given me to pursue this project. For both I am grateful.</p>

<p>As a member of the Gaulish Polytheist Community, and an aspiring member of the Toutâ Galation (both of which you may find <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/162531797160858/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/933692526717833/">here</a>, respectively), I will not condone, and in fact will condemn, exclusion of anyone from this religious practice on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, or anything of the like. It is unfortunate that I must specify this, and even more unfortunate that other groups taint the name of this beautiful religious custom (as well as many others) and co-opt them for their hate. I will have none of it here.</p>

<p>I find it also important here to explain my choice of liturgical language, and the liberties I have taken with it. I find that regular use of the Gaulish Language, in any form, is the single best way to reconnect with the past. Here I will likey often use “Gaulish” to refer to Continental Celtic as a whole; although the two are not synonymous, it is likely that the language of Celts accross the Continent was mostly mutually intelligible. Many of us within the community will also refer to the different varieties of reconstructed Gaulish as “dialects”, although the word is not used quite as it is meant. For this project, most of the liturgical vocabulary will be presented in Galâthach hAthevîu, or Modern Gaulish. It is a form of reconstructed Gaulish meant to represent the evolution of Gaulish into modern-day, had it survived antiquity. It follows the traces of sound and grammar in the late Gaulish inscriptions through to completion, and as a result bears only a superficial resemblance to Gaelic, more due to orthography than anything else. In vocabulary, phonology, and morphology, it is wholly Gaulish. I will, however, diverge from standard orthography by making use of the circumflex instead of the acute accent for long vowels. This is purely an aesthetic choice. I will be using Modern Gaulish not because I prefer to reconstructions of Classical Gaulish, but simply because it is the variety of Gaulish which I am most familiar with, most comfortable with, and find easiest to use. More information on Modern Gaulish can be found <a href="http://moderngaulish.com/">here</a>.</p>
