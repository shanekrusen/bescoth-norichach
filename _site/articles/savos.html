            <h2>Savos</h2>
            <p><strong>Etymology:</strong></p>

<p>The name <em>Savos</em> is undoubtably derived from the name of the Sava river. Šašel Kos, as she is wont to do, follows Šimunović in suggesting that the name of the Savus is paleo-European.[1][2] It is questionable, however, whether or not this hypothesis would ever find mass acceptance. Much more probable, it seems, is de Bernardo Stempel’s suggestion of a Celtic origin for <em>Sava</em>, meaning “that which winds”: from Celtic *<em>sōw-o-s/-ā</em>, in turn from IE *<em>sewh<sub>1</sub>-</em> ( = “to keep moving”).[3]</p>

<p><strong>Function:</strong></p>

<p>It may come as no surprise that <em>Savus’</em> role in  antiquity has been thoroughly explored by leading authors. He undoubtedly was patron of travellers, traders, merchants, and businessmen travelling along the Sava[4], which was essential for the local trade-economy.[5] It may also be of importance to note that archaeological finds which attest to <em>Savus</em> are only found along the upper course of the <em>Sava</em>. This is, potentially, because this part of the river was most dangerous, and so most travellers chose to ask for <em>Savus’</em> protection along it[6], or because it is possible that not <em>all</em> of a river’s course was viewed as sacred.[7] It is also worth noting that perhaps <em>Savus’</em> jurisdiction also extended beyond His role in protecting seafarers on the river. <em>Savus</em> has the honor of being invoked in the first Latin curse tablet explicitly invoking a river deity in Roman Europe.[8] The curse tablet asks <em>Savus</em> to drown, silence, or “drag down” the authors opponents in a legal proceeding.[9] This fact may imply that, in addition to water deities’ association with life and fertility, <em>Savus</em> is also intrinsically linked to the chthonic.[10] He is also attested as part of a divine couple with <em>Adsalluta</em>.[11]</p>

<p><strong>In Practice:</strong></p>

<p>Within <em>Bessus Noricon</em>, <em>Savus</em> is patron God of the river Sava. He is patron of travellers, merchants, and trade. He is also a chthonic deity who can be invoked in <em>defixiones</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretatio:</strong></p>

<p>As all river deities are incredibly localized, the closest Roman deity to <em>Savus</em>, especially in terms of importance to the local population, would probably be Tiberinus.</p>

<p><strong>Iconography:</strong></p>

<p>Although unknown in Norican art, it is possible to infer some iconography for <em>Savus</em> from the iconography of other cultures in antiquity. Older depictions of river gods in Roman, Greek, and Etruscan art are both anthropomorphic and zoomorphic, potentially with the implication that they are shape-shifter (which my stem from the fluid nature of rivers). They also appear on antifixes and occasionally as border decoration on shields, which may indicate a liminal nature of rivers and their patron deities. This ancient depiction, however, seems to have been overturned in river deities important to the national identity of a state, such as Tiberinus was to Rome. Tiberinus is depicted as an older man, reclined, and sometimes alongside a cornucopia or an oar.[12] These attributes, due to the <em>Sava</em> rivers importance to the identity of the Norican region, seem more fitting for <em>Savus</em>.</p>
