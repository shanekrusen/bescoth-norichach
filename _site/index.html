<p>The phonetic values of the above graphemes has been discussed under the section “sound changes”.</p>

<p>As regards to “s-“ before a consonant, it is dropped, and marked in writing with an apostrophe. In the spoken language, the appearance of a radical in a mutational context indicates the elision of “s-”, therefore indicating the mutation of “s-“.</p>

<p>The various mutations of the modern Celtic languages are categorised according to the phonetic processes which occur, e.g. softening, hardening, nasalisation etc. All of the modern Celtic languages have different kinds and combinations of mutations, although there are deep fundamental resemblances among all of them. The mutations proposed for the modern Gaulish language consist of a combination of phonetic processes, mostly voicing and spriantisation (see above). Therefore, it is easiest to describe this mutation as a “mixed mutation”. However, its description is irrelevant, as there is only one change for each sound.</p>

<p>Contexts for mutation</p>

<p>The contexts for mutation have become apparent throughout this document. It is posited that mutation has become established as a system for assisting with the conveying of grammatical meaning in the wake of the loss of case endings and therefore meaning, as discussed previously. As such, they represent a simple switch from marking the end of words for meaning to marking the start of words for meaning. This position is supported by Isaac (2007) who argues that VSO languages have a greater innate tendency to modify words word initially than word finally.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of contexts for mutation: contact mutation and grammatical mutation. The contact mutation category is the largest one. In contact mutation, a mutation is triggered by a lexeme immediately preceding the word affected. In grammatical mutation, a mutation is bestowed because of a grammatical condition or requirement, which may or may not be caused by a lexeme immediately preceding the word affected.</p>

<p>Contact mutations do not necessarily convey grammatical meaning in themselves; instead they usually assist in the marking of such meaning. However, such meaning would not be apparent in the absence of the lexemes triggering the mutation. As such, it can be said that a large part of the mutations featured in modern Gaulish are phonetic mutations rather than grammatical mutations. This situation is similar to the one prevailing in modern Breton, Welsh and Cornish, where some mutations occur for no apparent reason and carry no apparent grammatical meaning.</p>
